# Assignment 2

Maximum number of words for this document: 9000

**IMPORTANT**: In this assignment you will model the whole system. Within each of your models, you will have a *prescriptive intent* when representing the elements related to the feature you are implementing in this assignment, whereas the rest of the elements are used with a *descriptive intent*. In all your diagrams it is strongly suggested to used different colors for the prescriptive and descriptive parts of your models (this helps you in better reasoning on the level of detail needed in each part of the models and the instructors in knowing how to assess your models).   

**Format**: establish formatting conventions when describing your models in this document. For example, you style the name of each class in bold, whereas the attributes, operations, and associations as underlined text, objects are in italic, etc.

### Implemented feature

| ID  | Short name  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| F1  | Command | Player can control the main character using command line commands with the following syntax: ‘[command] [item]’. The commands we will implement are: move, open, break, inspect, help   |
| F2| Movements | Player can move through the environment using command: ‘move to [location]’ |

## Class diagram									
Author(s): Sarah

This chapter contains the specification of the UML class diagram of your system, together with a textual description of all its elements.

`Figure representing the UML class diagram`

The **Player** class represents the user, i.e. the person moving through the game. Their *name* is a string object that contains whatever name the user chooses. Their *inventory* is a list of Item objects, containing any objects that were picked up but not yet put down. This way, we keep a list of all items the player can use at a given time. The *currentLocation* is a Room object that indicates which room the player is in at a given time. The *getObjects* method returns a list of the player's current inventory, the *getCurrentRoom* method returns the player's current location, and the *setCurrentRoom* method changes the player's location to the given room. The *getInventory* method returns the player's current inventory, i.e. what items they are currently holding, while *addToInventory* adds an item to this list. The player class is associated with the Room class because it needs to be able to access the player's current location. It is also associated with the Item class, because it needs to keep track of the player's inventory. The association with the Action class is because a Player needs to be able to perform actions in order to change their location or inventory. 

The **Action** class represents all of the actions and movements a user can perform in the game. The *commandName* field is a string that the user inputs in order to perform an action. The *item* is the Item object that the action is being used on. The *room* is the Room object that the item is located in. The *doAction* method performs the action specified by CommandName, such as picking up, putting down, moving, and using an item. The *printInventory* method simply prints the player's current inventory, to see what items they can perform actions on. The Action class is connected to the Item class because each action needs to be performed on a specific item. The same holds for the Obstacle class; each obstacle will have actions that can be used on them. 

The **Item** class represents the items in the game that can be used by the player. The *name* field holds the name of the item as a string, the *location* field holds the Room that the item is in, and *usage* holds a string that explains what the item is used for. The *held* field represents whether or not the item is currently in the user's inventory. The *used* field represents whether or not the user has already used the item. The *getNameFromItem* method returns the name of the item and the Usage method returns the item's purpose, i.e. how the player can use it. *HoldItem* changes the item's state to held, and the *useItem* method similarly changes the used state to used. It is connected to the Room class because each room can have an unlimited number of items, and the Room class needs to access that information.

The **Obstacle** class represents any obstacles in a room, such as something blocking a door. The *itemNeeded* field contains what item the user needs to use in order to overcome the obstacle. The *open* field contains whether or not the player has overcome the obstacle. The Obstacle class, like the Item class, is associated with the Room class because each Room can have unlimited obstacles, and it needs to keep an inventory of those.

The **Setting** class represents the place the user is in, and contains all of the locations a player can go. The *rooms* field is a list of Room objects that holds every room that exists in the current game. The Setting class is composed with the Room class, because each setting can have unlimited rooms, and a room cannot exist without a setting. 

The **Room** class represents an individual room within the setting of the game. The *name* field is a string stating the name of the room. The *items* hashmap holds each Item object that is in the given room. The same holds for *obstacles*, except it contains Obstacle objects. *NextRooms* is a hashmap of rooms to which you can get to from the current room. The *script* is the string that the user will read when they enter the given room. The *getItemFromName* method returns the item object based on the name, and the *getNextRoomFromName* does the same, just for room objects. The *getNextRooms* method returns a hashmap containing all of the possible rooms you can get to from the current room. The *getRoomName* method returns the name of the room, and *getScript* returns the script. *RemoveItemsFromRoom* allows you to take an item out of a room based on the item name. *GetItems* returns a list of all of the items in the room. 

The **TimeLimit** class represents the time a user has left in the game. It will keep track of the player's time since starting the game, and assist the Main class in assessing whether the player has won the game. The *currentTime* field contains the user's current time since starting, and the *timeLimit* contains the maximum time the player has to complete the game. 

The **Main** class is where the execution of the game happens. It prompts the user to input a JSON file and then reads in the JSON file to execute the game from the file. The *startRoom* variable is a JSONObject indicating the room that the game starts in, and *endRoom* indicates the room that the game ends in. *RoomMap* and *itemMap* are hashmaps indicating which rooms contain which items, based on the information in the JSON file. *PlayerName* is simply a string containing the player's name, which comes from the user when the game prompts them to input their name. The Main class is able to access the Room class because the Main class needs to know where the player is and whether they have won yet or not. 

In this document you have to adhere to the following formatting conventions:
- the name of each **class** is in bold
- the *attributes*, *operations*, *associations*, and *objects* are in italic.

## State machine diagrams									
Author(s): Beth, Gemma

This chapter contains the specification of at least 2 UML state machines of your system, together with a textual description of all their elements. Also, remember that classes the describe only data structures (e.g., Coordinate, Position) do not need to have an associated state machine since they can be seen as simple "data containers" without behaviour (they have only stateless objects).

For each state machine you have to provide:
- the name of the class for which you are representing the internal behavior;
- a figure representing the part of state machine;
- a textual description of all its states, transitions, activities, etc. in a narrative manner (you do not need to structure your description into tables in this case). We expect 3-4 lines of text for describing trivial or very simple state machines (e.g., those with one to three states), whereas you will provide longer descriptions (e.g., ~500 words) when describing more complex state machines.

The goal of your state machine diagrams is both descriptive and prescriptive, so put the needed level of detail here, finding the right trade-off between understandability of the models and their precision.

## Sequence diagrams									
Author(s): Ben

This chapter contains the specification of at least 2 UML sequence diagrams of your system, together with a textual description of all its elements. Here you have to focus on specific situations you want to describe. For example, you can describe the interaction of player when performing a key part of the videogame, during a typical execution scenario, in a special case that may happen (e.g., an error situation), when finalizing a fantasy soccer game, etc.

For each sequence diagram you have to provide:
- a title representing the specific situation you want to describe;
- a figure representing the sequence diagram;
- a textual description of all its elements in a narrative manner (you do not need to structure your description into tables in this case). We expect a detailed description of all the interaction partners, their exchanged messages, and the fragments of interaction where they are involved. For each sequence diagram we expect a description of about 300-500 words.

The goal of your sequence diagrams is both descriptive and prescriptive, so put the needed level of detail here, finding the right trade-off between understandability of the models and their precision.

## Implementation									
Author(s): Ben, Beth, Gemma, Sam, Sarah

In this chapter you will describe the following aspects of your project:
- the strategy that you followed when moving from the UML models to the implementation code;
- the key solutions that you applied when implementing your system (for example, how you implemented the syntax highlighting feature of your code snippet manager, how you manage fantasy soccer matches, etc.);
- the location of the main Java class needed for executing your system in your source code;
- the location of the Jar file for directly executing your system;
- the 30-seconds video showing the execution of your system (you can embed the video directly in your md file on GitHub).

IMPORTANT: remember that your implementation must be consistent with your UML models. Also, your implementation must run without the need from any other external software or tool. Failing to meet this requirement means 0 points for the implementation part of your project.
