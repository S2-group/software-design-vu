# Assignment 2

Maximum number of words for this document: 9000

**IMPORTANT**: In this assignment you will model the whole system. Within each of your models, you will have a *prescriptive intent* when representing the elements related to the feature you are implementing in this assignment, whereas the rest of the elements are used with a *descriptive intent*. In all your diagrams it is strongly suggested to used different colors for the prescriptive and descriptive parts of your models (this helps you in better reasoning on the level of detail needed in each part of the models and the instructors in knowing how to assess your models).   

**Format**: establish formatting conventions when describing your models in this document. For example, you style the name of each class in bold, whereas the attributes, operations, and associations as underlined text, objects are in italic, etc.

## Class diagram									
Author(s): `name of the team member(s) responsible for this section`

This chapter contains the specification of the UML class diagram of your system, together with a textual description of all its elements.

`Figure representing the UML class diagram`

For each class (and data type) in the class diagram you have to provide a paragraph providing the following information:
- Brief description about what it represents
- Brief description of the meaning of each attribute
- Brief description of the meaning of each operation
- Brief description of the meaning of each association involving it (each association can be described only once in this deliverable)

Also, you can briefly discuss fragments of previous versions of the class diagram (with figures) in order to show how you evolved from initial versions of the class diagram to the final one.

In this document you have to adhere to the following formatting conventions:
- the name of each **class** is in bold
- the *attributes*, *operations*, *associations*, and *objects* are in italic.

## Object diagrams								
Author(s): `name of the team member(s) responsible for this section`

This chapter contains the description of a "snapshot" of the status of your system during its execution. 
This chapter is composed of a UML object diagram of your system, together with a textual description of its key elements.

## State machine diagrams									
Author(s): `name of the team member(s) responsible for this section`

This chapter contains the specification of at least 2 UML state machines of your system, together with a textual description of all their elements. Also, remember that classes the describe only data structures (e.g., Coordinate, Position) do not need to have an associated state machine since they can be seen as simple "data containers" without behaviour (they have only stateless objects).

For each state machine you have to provide:
- the name of the class for which you are representing the internal behavior;
- a figure representing the part of state machine;
- a textual description of all its states, transitions, activities, etc. in a narrative manner (you do not need to structure your description into tables in this case). We expect 3-4 lines of text for describing trivial or very simple state machines (e.g., those with one to three states), whereas you will provide longer descriptions (e.g., ~500 words) when describing more complex state machines.

The goal of your state machine diagrams is both descriptive and prescriptive, so put the needed level of detail here, finding the right trade-off between understandability of the models and their precision.

## Sequence diagrams									
Author(s): `name of the team member(s) responsible for this section`

This chapter contains the specification of at least 2 UML sequence diagrams of your system, together with a textual description of all its elements. Here you have to focus on specific situations you want to describe. For example, you can describe the interaction of player when performing a key part of the videogame, during a typical execution scenario, in a special case that may happen (e.g., an error situation), when finalizing a fantasy soccer game, etc.

For each sequence diagram you have to provide:
- a title representing the specific situation you want to describe;
- a figure representing the sequence diagram;
- a textual description of all its elements in a narrative manner (you do not need to structure your description into tables in this case). We expect a detailed description of all the interaction partners, their exchanged messages, and the fragments of interaction where they are involved. For each sequence diagram we expect a description of about 300-500 words.

The goal of your sequence diagrams is both descriptive and prescriptive, so put the needed level of detail here, finding the right trade-off between understandability of the models and their precision.

## Implementation									
Author(s): `name of the team member(s) responsible for this section`

In this chapter you will describe the following aspects of your project:
- the strategy that you followed when moving from the UML models to the implementation code;
- the key solutions that you applied when implementing your system (for example, how you implemented the syntax highlighting feature of your code snippet manager, how you manage fantasy soccer matches, etc.);
- the location of the main Java class needed for executing your system in your source code;
- the location of the Jar file for directly executing your system;
- the 30-seconds video showing the execution of your system (you can embed the video directly in your md file on GitHub).

IMPORTANT: remember that your implementation must be consistent with your UML models. Also, your implementation must run without the need from any other external software or tool. Failing to meet this requirement means 0 points for the implementation part of your project.
