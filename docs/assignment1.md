<When defining both functional features and quality requirements, remember that you will need to come back to them in Assignments 2 and 3 and explicitly state how specific parts of models/implementation satisfy them.>

### Functional features

As a preamble to the table, you can discuss the main line of reasoning you applied for defining the functional features provided in the table.

| ID  | Short name  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| F1  | Tags | Code snippets can be tagged via freely-defined labels called tags  |
| F2  | Commands  | The player can control the main character by issuing command-line commands following this syntax: `command-name [target-objects]*`. The available `command-names` are the following: <br/> - move: ... <br/> - use: ... <br/> - inspect: ... <br/> |
| F3  | Movements  | The main character shall move freely in the environment according  |
| F4  | ... | ... |

### Quality requirements
Author(s): `name of the team member(s) responsible for this section`

As a preamble to the table, you can discuss the main line of reasoning you followed for coming up with the quality requirements listed below.

| ID  | Short name  | Quality attribute | Description  |
|---|---|---|---|
| QR1  | Commands sanity checks | Reliability  | When the player issues a command, the syntax of the command shall always get validated against the format specified in F2 |
| QR2  | Extensible world | Maintainability  | The video game shall be easilty extendable in terms of levels, worlds, interaction points  |
| QR3  | Instantaneous results | Responsiveness  | Once the scores of all soccer players are provided by the user, the results of the virtual matches shall be available within 1 second |
| QR4  | ... | ... | ... |

Each quality requirement must be tagged with the corresponding quality attribute (see corresponding slides of the first lecture for knowing them).
