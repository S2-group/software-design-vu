## Introduction
Author(s): Sofia Konovalova & Bogdan-Petre Cercel

Ever since Pong was released in 1958, the video game scene has been steadily growing. Over time, technologies improved and the popularity and general interest in games have boomed, especially in the early 2000's.
Video games are an opportunity to escape the world, and train your brain in various different activities. Games have a wide variety of genres, ranging from full on simulations of physics to simple interactive novels with branching stories.
[*Zork*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) is one of the first interactive computer games, released in 1980. It is a text adventure game, where the protagonist interacts with the virtual
world and other players. These games have evolved from simple text-based games to more complex artistic games of today. Going back to the classics, this project will be a minimal version of Zork, which takes place in a post-apocalyptic world.
Our protagonist wakes up in the middle of the day, seeing an emergency alert on his phone of an imminent missile strike. They go on a mission to find their
family or risks dying in the nuclear strike.

The minimal game of Zork consists of a protagonist, a virtual world, and objects and virtual characters. We took inspiration from the Black Isle Studios
game [Fallout 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/38410/Fallout_2_A_Post_Nuclear_Role_Playing_Game/) with the post-apocalyptic world using simple objects as currency. In the *Fallout* game series, bottle caps are used as currency. In our game,
sporks are used as the currency (the word rhymes with Zork). Post-apocalyptic genre games became incredibly popular in the mid-2000s to the early 2010s, so it is difficult to
point to a specific game that inspired that world in our game.

The project track specifies that our game be loyal to the original Zork, which will run completely in the terminal. The termainal with have color-coded text, in order
to indicate to the player whether text describes a player, a situation, or the protagonists' health, etc. As an extension, we can create an alternative version
of the game that runs with a GUI, to mimic the second-generation text-based games. A "GUI" can even be included within the console that is used to play the game, by using Java libraries such as Text-IO.
With games such as Zork and various other text-based adventure games, the target audience is teenagers and young adults, but as this game will not
include anything incredibly explicit and violent like the *Fallout* game series, this game may be played at an age.

This gameplay will be achieved by creating models of the two important factors of the game: the scenes in which the character is in at a given moment,
and the characters that the player encounters in the scenes. Each of the scenes will be based on the same template, but with different objects, characters
and places to explore. Since we are working with object-oriented programming, a separate Scenes model will be created, with a different scene being created
at points in the game with specific parameters, with some possibly randomized. Each scene will have different options but falling under one of the three
umbrellas of movement, exploration or interaction. The interaction can be with characters, objects. Interactions can also be of different types, like picking
up an object or walking in a certain direction. These interactions help the player to reach the goal or to fail and lose the game.

### Functional features

As a preamble to the table, you can discuss the main line of reasoning you applied for defining the functional features provided in the table.

| ID  | Short name  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| F1  | Commands | Game wiill have a text-based **option system**, the player can type different commands in a command prompt which will result in **different actions**(F3). |
| F2  | Interface | The game will be played inside the default console of the device. Everything is in text. Desired: ASCII art in some situations. |
| F3  | Actions | Typing different commands will result in different actions in the game world. The actions are: <ul>
  <li>Movement</li>
  <li>Attacking</li>
  <li>Conversation with other characters</li>
  <li>Opening doors/using car keys</li>
  <li>Dying (restarts the game)</li>
  <li>Healing</li>
  <li>Picking up items</li>
  <li>Examining an item/room/scenario</li>
  <li>Sleeping</li> </ul> |
| F4  | Items | There will be a multitude of different items which can be added to the inventory of the player, such as weapons, keys and ammunition. |
| F5 | Characters | The game will have characters, each with different **statistics** (F6) defining what they are (enemies, friendlies, etc.) |
| F6 | Statistics | The game will have statistics for the player and other characters in the game. Statistics can be:<ul>
  <li>health points</li>
  <li>debuffs (hangover, wounds, bleeding) </li>
  <li>aggressiveness (for enemies) </li>
  <li>health points</li></ul> |
| F7 | Combat | The game will have a very simple **combat system**. If the player is able to attack a target, depending on the aggressiveness of that target, it can attack the character back. If the attack hits depends on a 50/50 chance. *Desired*: The combat system shall have a modifier mechanic where the chance to hit and damage depend on. "Stronger" enemies have high modifiers, thus will do more damage. |
| F8 | Inventory | The game will have a simple **inventory system** using slots, for a weapon, currency, etc. Simple means no weight system, no volume system. There is a weapon slot, which is not stackable. Ammunition, currency and other items are stackable. |
| F9 | Time Mechanic | The game will have a **time system** for story-telling purposes. Time will be implemented with a turn-based system, for examples, for every *x* amount of turns *y* amount of time passes, with some actions passing time immediately, such as sleeping. |

### Quality requirements
Author(s): Claudia Grigoras

As a preamble to the table, you can discuss the main line of reasoning you followed for coming up with the quality requirements listed below.

| ID  | Short name  | Quality attribute | Description  |
|---|---|---|---|
| QR1  | Commands sanity checks | Reliability | When the player issues a command, the syntax of the command shall always get validated against the format specified in F3 |
| QR2  | Adaptable system | Maintainability & Responsiveness | The video game shall be easily adaptable to new stories and worlds. The system should not be dependent to one story only (when changing the story or the world, only variables and actions should change) |
| QR3  | Loading game state | Responsiveness | Once the player types in a command, loading the game state shall be executed in less than 5 seconds regardless of the computer capabilities |
| QR4  | Accessing the commands | Usability & Availability | The players shall at any point within the game be able to access the available commands at that particular level in game (through the command specified at F3 â€“ help) |
| QR5  | Secured connections | Security | When playing in a multiplayer mode, the system should provide a safe network connection to both user  |
| QR6  | Real-time commands multiplayer mode | Responsiveness & Reliability | The system shall have a maximum latency of 2 seconds for providing commands and loading game state between 2 players in multiplayer mode |
| QR7  | Un-biased game | Reliability & Responsiveness | The system shall ensure that the statistics provided at F6 are correct and un-biased and that the combat mentioned at F7 is unbiased and always gives a 50/50 chance roll. |
| QR8  | Reliable data  | Reliability & usability | The system shall provide correct inventory responses and storing (F7) and correct timing within the game (F8) |


Each quality requirement must be tagged with the corresponding quality attribute (see corresponding slides of the first lecture for knowing them).

### Java libraries
Author(s): Wilkin van Roosmalen

The following table contains a list of Java libraries that will be used for this project.

| Name (with link) | Description  |
|---|---|
| [TextIO](https://text-io.beryx.org/releases/latest/) | Text-IO is a Java library that is used in making console applications that read interactive input from the user. It by default uses text terminals that are backed by Java's default java.io.Console library. This is perfect for this project as  we are required to use the terminal as the game screen, but using this library we can make the terminal more interactive than the default console. |
| [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) | Gson is a Java serialization and deserialization library maintained by Google. It is used to convert Java objects to JSON files and back on the go.  In this project we can use this library to read configuration files hold attributes of game objects. We can also save game states and player information if we decide to add this feature. |
| [Apache Commons RNG](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-rng/) | Apache Commons RNG provides different implementation of pseud-random number generation algorithms and utility methods related to RNG. This library will prove useful when implementing features that depend on randomness, such as the combat system. |
| [KryoNet](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryonet) | KryoNet provides a simple API for communicating between clients. Using a its own serialization library (Kryo), it sends objects through the TCP and/or UDP protocol(s). If we get to implementing multiplayer features KryoNet will simplify networking immensely. |
| [Tinylog](https://tinylog.org/v2/) | Tinylog is a lightweight, configurable, logging framework. It is easy to use as it provides a static logger that can be utilized in a lot of situations. When working on a project it is always useful to log what exactly is happening. Because we use the command line interface `System.out` is not a great option. With Tinylog we can easily change where logs are send and/or saved. |
